# Financial Models Repository

This repository contains three financial modeling projects designed to address key challenges in the finance domain:

1. **Option Pricing Model** - Calculates the net value of natural gas storage contracts.
2. **Loan Default Prediction Model** - Predicts the likelihood of loan defaults based on borrower features.
3. **FICO Bucket Classifier Model** - Classifies credit scores into predefined buckets to assess creditworthiness.

## Features

- **Option Pricing Model:** Incorporates injection/withdrawal schedules, market prices, and associated costs to determine storage contract value.
- **Loan Default Prediction Model:** Leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of default based on borrower attributes.
- **FICO Bucket Classifier Model:** Categorizes credit scores into buckets for simplified credit risk assessment.
